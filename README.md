# FactoryCompiler

CLI tool for doing production planning for Satisfactory.

Not intended to be a solver; given a factory design, it simply works out the necessary inputs
and expected outputs.

Could probably do this with a spreadsheet but I don't feel like reading all of Google's docs in
search of That One Function.

I do not expect to finish this project any time soon, because coding late gives me a headache.
